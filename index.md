### Spring 2021

<br />

**Overview.** The deployment of Artificial Intelligence systems in multiple domains of society raises fundamental challenges and concerns, such as accountability, liability, fairness, transparency and privacy. The dynamic nature of AI systems requires a new set of skills informed by ethics, law, and policy to be applied throughout the life cycle of such systems: design, development and deployment. It also involves ongoing collaboration among data scientists, computer scientists, lawyers and ethicists. Tackling these challenges calls for an interdisciplinary approach: *deconstructing* these issues by discipline and *reconstructing* with an integrated mindset, principles and practices between data science, ethics and law. This course aims to do so by bringing together students with diverse disciplinary backgrounds into teams that work together on joint tasks in an intensive series of in-class sessions. These sessions will include lectures, discussions, and group work. 

This unique course also brings together students from three institutes: Cornell Tech, Tel Aviv University, and Technion with instructors and teaching assistants from each.

9:30 am - 1:30 pm (Eastern Time Zone)  
4:30 pm - 8:30 pm (Israel Time Zone)  

<u>Note: the first class will take place exceptionally at 9:00 am - 1:00 pm (EST) / 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm (IST)</u>

**Structure.** The course comprises nine meetings of four clock hours, in a workshop format. The topics explore some of the core issues in the landscape of Responsible AI, law, ethics and society.

**Learning Objectives.** By the end of the course, the students will…

1. **Multidisciplinary dialogue**  
By the end of the course, the students will be able to communicate with professionals from other disciplines, identify gaps in the meaning of terms and perspectives, and develop a shared language.
   
1. **Responsible AI**  
By the end of the course, the students will …
   1. be aware of the impact of AI on individuals, groups, society and humanity, and proactively spot ethical issues and scan for unintended consequences and potential harms.
   1. possess introductory knowledge and skills to oversight and audit AI systems through their life cycle (design, development and deployment).
   1. be able to find and use resources to achieve all of the above.
1. **Professional Responsibility**  
By the end of the course, the students will take the first steps in shaping their responsibility as professionals, and be motivated to act upon it.

**Format.** The teaching is based on the [*signature pedagogy*](https://wiki.ubc.ca/Signature_Pedagogies) of each discipline; [*case-studies*](https://casestudies.law.harvard.edu/the-case-study-teaching-method/) for Law and *iterated and interactive research of data* (e.g., with Jupyter Notebook) for Data Science. These two pedagogies are being used in every class, accessible to all of the students, and integrated together.

**Assignments, Final Project and Evaluation.**

Every class is built around one central task that requires integration of law and data science perspectives. The tasks are performed  in teams which will be formed before the start of the course. Each team consists of students from both disciplines.  

The teams students will present their work at least twice during the course, and all of the teams are required to submit a one-pager memo or a presentation of a few slides at the end of each class.
 
In their final project, the teams will be asked to develop a new case-study which makes use of data sets and data science techniques to demonstrate a legal\ethical dilemma regarding Responsible AI, Law, Ethics and Society.

The assignments and the final project will be evaluated primarily on the quality of integration between the law and data science perspectives.
