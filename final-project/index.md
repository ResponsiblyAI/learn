# Course // Responsible AI, Law, Ethics & Society

## Instructions For The Final Project

### Assignment summary

The final project consists of creating a 9th class (an additional class) for the course. The only difference is that this time, *you* are the instructors, not the students.
This is a team project, which you will complete with your original teams. Please note that grading is also by team, similar to other coursework.


Through this experience, we intend for you to engage with the material at a different angle -- in order to create a 9th class, your team should collaborate not only to solve a predefined task, but to collaboratively brainstorm, understand how the multiple disciplines overlap and influence each other for the topic of interest, and practically implement their ideas. 


In more details:
In your final project, you will plan a “ninth class” of our course, "Responsible AI, Law, Ethics & Society" that engages students from the different disciplines to work together in solving joint tasks. While you will not be actually teaching the full class, you should prepare a **3 hour** class plan with details on the structure of the class including the various activities / content taught.
You will present your proposed class (~15 minutes) during the final class of this course.  


### Timeline

* **Apr 12**: Project proposal. An initial reflection about your project (see the course pack for the submission link).
* **Apr 13-14**: Mandatory office hours.
* **April 25th - May 6th** - Optional office hours.
* **May 10th** (class 8th): Oral presentation (8th class) + Submission (before class).
* **May 13th**: Grades released.



### Choosing a topic

Your proposed class' topic should include both a specific domain (i.e. transportation, health, HR, finance, housing, environment,  etc.) as well as a professional topic (i.e. liability, transparency, fairness, human in the loop, competition, etc.)

You may choose one of the sectors or topics that we have covered in class, but please do not use the same *combination* of sectors/topics and make sure that the class is not similar to any of the ones already taught during the course. Also, we encourage you to be creative and choose a new sector and topic altogether! Feel free to consult with the course instructors as you choose your sector and topic. 

### Structure

The structure of your proposed class should be similar to the ones presented at the course. It should include a table summarizing the flow of the class as well as a breakdown of the proposed activities. Ideally, your report should include:

- Background (explaining about your chosen topic, what it includes, reasons for choosing it, etc.)

- A table with a breakdown of all the planned activities for the course duration (3 hours). Please see pasted below an example from our first class.Try to make sure that the activities are "mixed" such that they include plenary sessions with short presentations as well as "hands on" activities in the breakout rooms / discussion. (no need for much details here, only a title and a short explanation of what the activity includes).

- With respect to the proposed presentations - no need to actually detail the exact content to be taught there. Only describe what topics the presentations will cover.

- With respect to the interactive activities, please provide exact details, as if these tasks are presented to the students for them to complete.
For example, if the task includes a legal case study, please write the case study and the specific questions.

- If the task includes analyzing a model, please provide the dataset and the guidelines.
Importantly, the activities should be joint in nature such that students from the various disciplines will need to contribute in order for the team to make any progress.


### Submission

Please submit your project by **May 10th, 2022, 9 am EDT / 3 pm CET / 4 pm IST**, using **Gradescope**.
The project shall be in the form of a PDF, accompanied by a Jupyter Notebook. 



### Evaluation

The final project accounts for 40% of your final grade. Like the other components of the final grade, the project will be graded on a team-basis.  The breakdown of the evaluation criteria is below. 

- 15% of the final project grade will be based on the presentation at the 8th class. 
- 85% of the project grade will be based on the submitted project itself.

Criteria for grading both the presentation and the submitted output are:

- Demonstration of collaboration and joint work in both preparing the class and in the proposed activities themselves (which should not only include tasks for the different disciplines but make sure that the tasks cannot be properly addressed without the combined knowledge and skills of both disciplines).
- Demonstration of in-depth thinking and development of the activities.
- Creativity in choosing the topic and developing the activities.
- Clarity of the class and its different activities.
