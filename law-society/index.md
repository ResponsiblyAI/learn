# Course // Responsible AI, Law & Society
### Spring 2020

<br />

The deployment of Artificial Intelligence systems in our society raises multiple fundamental challenges and concerns, such as liability, fairness and privacy. Tackling these issues calls for an interdisciplinary approach, such as forming an integrated mindset, principles and practices between Data Science and Law. This course aims to do so by bringing together master students from both two disciplines into teams working together in a series of workshop-style classes.

**Audience.** Multidisciplinary: around half of the students are Law master students from University of Haifa, and the other half are Data Science master students from Technion.

**Structure.** We will have six meetings, which will last four hours each in a workshop format. The topics explore some of the core issues in the landscape of AI, law and society.

**Learning Objectives.** At the end of the workshop, the students will…

1. … be aware of the impact of AI on individuals, groups, society and humanity, and proactively *spot ethical issues* and *scan for unintended consequences and potential harms*.
1. … be able to communicate with professionals from other disciplines, and *jointly translate* between the two domains
1. … possess *introductory* knowledge and skills to *oversight* and *audit* AI systems through their life cycle (design, development and deployment).
1. … be able to *find and use resources* to achieve all of the above.
1. [Data Scientists only] … take the first steps in shaping their *responsibility as professionals*, and be *motivated* to act upon it.

**Format.** The teaching is based on the signature pedagogy of each discipline; case-studies for Law and researching with Jupyter Notebook for Data Science. These two pedagogies are being used in every class, exposed to all of the students, and integrated together.

**Tasks, Project and Evaluation.** Every class is built around one central task that requires integration of law and data science perspectives. The tasks are done in teams which will be formed before the start of the course. Each team consists of around two students from each discipline.  
Teams will present their work at least twice along the course, and all of the teams need to submit a one-pager at the end of each class.  
Finally, in the final project the teams will create a case-study with data, similar to what was presented in class, regarding an AI and Law issue.  
The evaluation is focused  around the integration of the law and data science.
